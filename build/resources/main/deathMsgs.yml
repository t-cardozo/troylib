  - "Oh, hey, you're back."
  - "So, how was the dying?"
  - "By using this New-U station, you have forfeited your right to reproduce."
  - "Hyperion would like to remind you that there is only one thing worse than respawning, and that is not respawning."
  - "Between you and us, that thing that killed you is a total dick. Please disregard this message if you committed suicide."
  - "Hyperion recommends swearing vengeance on the thing that killed you, unless it was an inanimate object such as a cliff."
  - "Rise from your grave! (Reference to Altered Beast)"
  - "Permanent death? Schmermanent...schmeath."
  - "The Hyperion corporation suggests: Live! LIIIIIIIIVVVVVVVVE!"
  - "Do not worry about the afterlife, Hyperion customer! Hell is reserved exclusively for pedophiles, and people who buy Jakobs munitions."
  - "The Hyperion corporation wishes to clarify that the bright light you saw after death was our digistruct technology, and not a higher power. Not higher than Hyperion, anyway."
  - "If any idiot ever tells you that life would be meaningless without death, Hyperion recommends killing them."
  - "Aaaaaand RESPAWN!"
  - "R-r-r-r-respawn!"
  - "Hyperion recommends channeling your post-death frustration into pre-death vengeful anger!"
  - "Hyperion would like to take this opportunity to say: cha-ching!"
  - "The Hyperion corporation would like to remind you that the afterlife is extremely boring, and not worth visiting."
  - "The Hyperion corporation is sure none of that was your fault."
  - "Hyperion recommends checking for any excess limbs before continuing your adventure."
  - "Hyperion says: back on your feet and show 'em what for!"
  - "Hyperion suggests that you do not think about the fact that this is only a digital reconstruction of your original body, which died the first time you respawned. Do NOT think about this!"
  - "The Hyperion corporation reminds you that all spawncampers will be permanently banned from this plane of existence."
  - "Anyone can live. Have the courage to die!"
  - "So long as you believe in yourself, nothing can TRULY kill you! Except Handsome Jack."
  - "Greetings, clone-of-the-recently-deceased! Good luck in your future endeavors!"
  - "Hyperion suggests that you rejoice in your temporary death! A victory achieved without suffering is no victory at all!"
  - "Hyperion hopes your death was a learning experience, but wouldn't mind if you made the same mistake just a few more times just to be sure."
  - "Hyperion is offering a ninety percent off sale on all New-U respawns! This offer expires in three-two-one-zero aww, better luck next time."
  - "Hyperion says: afterlife, schmafterlife."
  - "The Hyperion corporation respects all forms of life, so long as they pass a credit check."
  - "Hyperion is not responsible for any fingers, toes, or breasts added during the respawn process."
  - "Dying is awesome! All of the cool kids are doing it!"
  - "The Hyperion corporation welcomes you back from your visit to the undiscovered country."
  - "Hyperion asks: why die when you can respawn?"
  - "The Hyperion Corporation: We make your life. Period."
  - "Eager for revenge against whomever forced you into this unfortunate state? Why not upgrade your arsenal with some Hyperion firearms?"
  - "The Hyperion corporation wishes to remind you that heroes die many deaths; cowards taste but one. Or something."
  - "Perhaps if you'd bought more quality Hyperion munitions, you would not need to use the Hyperion quality New-U station as much! Just a thought!"
  - "Don't think of your death as failure; think of it as fun! Don't think of Hyperion's New-U respawn charges as war profiteering, think of them as war... fun!"
  - "Enjoy your new you!"
  - "Thanks for using this Hyperion New-U station! Please die again!"
  - "So, how are things?"
  - "Oh, it's you again."
  - "The Hyperion corporation: You don't die, until we say so."
  - "Consider me your own personal phoenix down."
  - "I cast: revive!"
  - "Rise from ye olde grave!"
  - "Failed your saving throw, huh?"
  - "At least you don't have to roll a new character."
  - "When you play the game of Vaults, you win! Or you respawn, and win a few minutes later."
  - "Warning! This New-U Station is not canon."
  - "Worry not -- Tina is a forgiving goddess."
  - "It's all fun and games until someone loses a kidney."
  - "Don't worry, we'll just retcon that."
  - "I hope your fantasies involve dying a lot."
  - "Respawn! Because permadeath runs are for weirdos."
  - "Live again, adventurer!"
  - "Don't die now, you've still got quests to finish!"
  - "At least the game's not too easy, right?"
  - "Back at 'em, heroic knight!"
  - "There ain't no magic like resurrection magic, because resurrection magic is... highly expensive."
  - "Next time, you might wanna spend a healing surge."
  - "Just so you know, you're technically undead now."
  - "You're not dead -- huzzah!"
  - "Resurrection!"
  - "Lives? Where we're going we don't need lives."
  - "Please insert coin. Nah, just playing."
  - "Hollow reversed."
  - "Death means nothing in this fantasy world!"
  - "Doing good?"
  - "Fantasy worlds, right?"
  - "Awww, again?"
  - "Arise!"
  - "Thank you for using this personal necromancy station."
  - "So, how does it feel to be a zombie?"
  - "You might wanna put more points into vitality."
  - "You could always respec."
  - "Get back on your mortal coil!"
  - "Maybe there's a healer somewhere looking for a group."
  - "Maybe you need a tank to soak up some aggro."
  - "A fantastic death in a fantastic world!"
  - "Now go show those orcs/knights/wizards what for!"
  - "Here -- have your hit points back!"
  - "That looked like it hurt."
  - "Man, am I sick of talking in this pleasant-ass voice."
  - "If you die in Tina's imagination, you die for real."
  - "The power of imagination stings like a bitch, huh?"
  - "Don't worry. Moxxi digs scars."
  - "Necromancy is the bestomancy."
  - "I cast my Resurrect Vault Hunter spell!"
  - "You smell kind of like butts and dead people."
  - "Yea, verily -- respawn thee!"
  - "So, how was hell?"
  - "Respawning. It's like reincarnation, without the BS."
  - "Get up, and get back in the fight soldier!"
  - "You're not dead 'til I say you are!"
  - "There'll be time to sleep when you're dead, and YOU'RE NOT DEAD!"
  - "Shake yourself down and get back out there, soldier!"
  - "I ain't done with you yet, soldier!"
  - "Rise and shine, soldier!"
  - "EVERYBODY UP!"
  - "It's rise and shine time, maggot!"
  - "Another glorious day in the service of Dahl!"
  - "Don't think about your previous horrible death! I SAID DON'T THINK ABOUT IT!"
  - "Dying's good for you! Puts hair on your chest!"
  - "Suck it up and get back on the job!"
  - "You ain't no kind of soldier 'til you've been killed at least once."
  - "No time for slacking off! Get back out there!"
  - "Back on your feet, soldier! No time to waste."
  - "No death is wasted in the service of Dahl. Now move out, soldier!"
  - "OK, let's move out. Give me some double-time!"
  - "Get your head back in the game, soldier!"
  - "Hey -- looks like this Dahl New-U saved your butt, soldier!"
  - "Suck it up, soldier! And use it! USE THE PAIN!"
  - "YOU WILL FIND NO PEACE IN DEATH, MAGGOT!"
  - "THERE IS NO AFTERLIFE, JUST AN ETERNITY OF DUTY!"
  - "Need time to catch your breath soldier? TOO BAD! HUT-HUT-HUT!"
  - "DOUBLE TIME! QUICK MARCH! BACK TO THE LINE, SOLDIER!"
  - "Remember: DAHL OWNS YOUR BODY AND SOUL! Assuming you have one."
  - "Back into the fray soldier! Double-time!"
  - "Move out and try not to die again, maggot! These things are expensive!"
  - "Did the old you get killed out there, soldier? Then you need a Dahl New-U!"
  - "Death is a dereliction of duty. Move, MOVE, MOVE!"
  - "Only thing better than a dead Dahl soldier is a live one!"
  - "You dead, soldier? Then get youself even!"
  - "Pep it up, soldier! Look like you want it!"
  - "Welcome back to life, soldier! Make it a good one!"
  - "God-DAMN! It's another fine Dahl soldier, ready for the front line!"
  - "It is a legal requirement that we state: Dahl New-U is produced under license from Hyperion."
  - "Just remember, you died doing what you loved! And what you were told to do!"
  - "Congratulations on dying for Dahl. There's no greater honor!"
  - "Keep that fire in your belly, and make it work for you!"
  - "Get your ass back out there, soldier!"
  - "A coward dies a thousand deaths -- but you could go on forever, thanks to Dahl!"
  - "You got a choice, soldier: be Dahl, or be dead. Now pick again."
  - "Get out of here, soldier. I don't want to see you back again for a while!"
  - "How did you slip into this army, soldier?! Let's step it up!"
  - "Dying on duty is a treasonous offence! Punishable by death!"
  - "There you are soldier, good as new! There were very few bits left over."
  - "Dahl salutes you, soldier! Now get back out there and give 'em hell!"
  - "Are you gonna let whatever killed you get away with it? HELL NO! Get you some vengeance, soldier!"
  - "Get back out there -- and this time keep your god-damn head down!"
  - "Well those maggots don't got you yet, do they?! Looks like they're gonna have to keep waiting!"
  - "Death is just God's way of making you angrier! YOU ANGRY YET, SOLDIER?!"
  - "Bummer, right?"
  - "Deaths like that will be a thing of the past once Pandora is colonized."
  - "Chairman Tassiter was not surprised by your failure."
  - "Chairman Tassiter isn't angry, just... disappointed."
  - "Go show those Lost Legion bastards what for!"
  - "Pandora needs you! Stop dying so much."
  - "Accuracy. Immortality. Hyperion."
  - "Seriously, these New-U stations aren't canon."
  - "Enjoy your stay in Helios station!"
  - "Hyperion contractors are entitled to New-U access at a significant discount!"
  - "The Hyperion family: we take care of our own."
  - "Existence: because the alternative is stupid."
  - "Why die when you could be productive?"
  - "Were you using cover? You should really use cover."
  - "Believe me, I'm pissed on your behalf."
  - "Chairman Tassiter says: ha. Then he drew a picture of you on fire."
  - "Welcome back!"
  - "Better luck next time!"
  - "You can do it!"
  - "Good luck!"
  - "Have a better one!"
  - "You can't die yet!"
  - "The Lost Legion won't quit -- neither should you!"
  - "Don't get discouraged or everyone will die and it will be your fault."
  - "If you quit, Pandora and Elpis will explode. So don't quit."
